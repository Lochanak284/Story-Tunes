            <p><font size="30px">Krishna and Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita</font><br><br>
            As the great Kurukshetra war was about to begin, Arjuna, the mighty warrior of the Pandavas, stood on the battlefield. 
            He looked across at the Kaurava army and saw his own relatives, teachers, and friends ready to fight against him.<br><br>
            Overwhelmed with grief and doubt, Arjuna put down his bow and said to Lord Krishna, his charioteer, “I cannot fight. 
            How can I kill those I love, even for the sake of a kingdom?<br><br>
            Krishna smiled gently and replied, “Arjuna, this body is temporary, but the soul is eternal. Those who die in battle for righteousness attain heaven, and those who live achieve honor. 
            Do not let attachment cloud your duty.”<br><br>
            Arjuna was still unsure. Krishna continued, “It is your dharma as a warrior to fight for justice.
            By doing your duty selflessly, without attachment to the outcome, you will achieve liberation.”<br><br>
            Krishna then revealed his divine form—the Vishwaroopa—and showed Arjuna the vastness of the universe,
            where he saw life, death, and creation as part of a single, divine cycle.<br><br>
            Awed and inspired, Arjuna regained his courage, picked up his bow, and pledged to fight for dharma (righteousness).<br><br><br>
            MORAL: PERFORM YOUR DUTY SELFLESSLY, WITH FAITH IN THE DIVINE PLAN, AND WITHOUT ATTACHMENT TO SUCCESS OR FAILURE.</p>
